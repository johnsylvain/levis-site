		<p>For my senior capstone project at Purdue, I worked with 3 other students to create a web application for Lafayette Instrument Company, the world's leading manufacturer of polygraph equipment.  We created a responsive digital reference application that allows examiners to access several user guides for the polygraph examination process, as well as search for keywords.</p>

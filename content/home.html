		<h2>hello.</h2>
		<p>My name is Levi Matthan Schrumpf.</p>  
		<p>I am a son, a brother, a friend, a designer, a musician, a believer, and a child at heart.</p>
		<p>I currently work as the Director of Design &amp; User Experience for Expimetrics, and do pro bono work for Songs Against Slavery, a nonprofit that organizes concerts to fight sex trafficking.</p>
		<p>This is a site showcasing a small portion of the interface and graphic design work I've done.</p>
		<p>Designing and creative work are wonderful things, but most of all I love people.  If you'd like to talk about design, something you need done, life, or anything else, shoot me an email at: </p><a href="mailto=levimatthan@gmail.com">levimatthan@gmail.com</a>

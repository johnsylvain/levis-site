		<h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">hello.</h2>
		<p>My name is Levi Matthan Schrumpf.</p>  
		<p>I am a son, a brother, a friend, a designer, a musician, a believer, and a child at heart.</p>
		<p>I graduated from Purdue University last December with a Bachelors in Computer Graphics Technology, specializing in Web Design and Development. For the past two years, I've worked as the Director of Design &amp; User Experience for Expimetrics, a startup I've helped build. I also do freelance work for various clients, and pro bono work for nonprofits like Songs Against Slavery.</p>
		<p>This is a site showcasing a small portion of the UI and graphic design and development work I've done.</p>
		<p>When I'm not designing, I'm probably working on music from my home studio. My first release is coming soon, and I couldn't be more excited about it!</p>
		<p>Designing and creative work are wonderful things, but most of all I love people.  If you'd like to talk about design, something you need done, life, or anything else, <a class='contactlink' href="contact">get in touch with me!</a></p>

		<p>Expimetrics is a West Lafayette-based startup where I have worked as Director of Design and User Experience since April 2015.  Expi is an experience-sampling platform for social scientists.  It consists of a web application, where scientists and researchers can create projects, build and schedule surveys, and select target demographics, as well as a native mobile application for participants to take surveys and input question, audio, photo, and video data.  I have designed all user interfaces for the company's products, as well as their logo and all marketing assets.</p>
